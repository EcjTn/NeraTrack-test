# NeraTrack-test


```
This test project lets Node.js run a Python script (main.py) and get the result. It uses exec() to run the script and saves whatever the script prints (or any errors) in a variable. 
Which is also reusable later in your app, like showing it on frontend or using it in other parts of your code.
And random figures/fake datas aswell for test.
```

- Will soon add some simple html&css to show outputs thats not only in CLI
